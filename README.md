# Proiect TSC - Openbook e-book reader

## Introduction

For this project, I have implemented an open source e-book reader using ***Autodesk Fusion360***.
The architecture is based on an ESP32-C6 low power microcontroller (+ Wi-Fi & Bluetooth).

The display is using e-paper ink. The project supports micro SD reading through the specialized
interface and USB type C charging for a Polymer Lithium-Ion battery, prioritizing performance
and efficient power consumption.
